# Contributing Guidelines
Pull request are always welcome and I appreciate any help on this project. This doc will hopefully make it easier for people to help contribute to this project.

## Setup
* Fork the repo and clone the repo locally
* Install main library dependencies
  * Run `npm install` in the root of the project
* Install dev dependencies
  * Change to the `dev` directory
  * Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies

## Local Development
This repo contains a `dev` directory to make it easier to test and debug changes made to the library. Currently, it just is used to test components but in the future I would like this to turn into interactive examples for the docs as well.

### Steps for Local Development
* In the root folder run `npm start`. This will watch the `lib` folder for changes and then transpile any changes. Once transpiled, the changes will copied to the `dev` directory and replace the `ng-block-ui` dependency.
* In a separate terminal run `npm start` in the `dev` directory. This will spin up a server with the dev app. Whenever changes are made to the `dev` or `lib` directory the server will reload.
